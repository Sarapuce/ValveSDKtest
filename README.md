# ValveSDKtest

Used to test some stuff with Valve SDK.

For the moment, I can only generate a Steam3Cookie for CS:GO, I don't think I will do something else

If you want to use it, you will need steam_api.dll which I think is not in the steam installation folder by default. You can get it here : https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted

You also need a file named steam_appid.txt with the steamappID of the game. For exemple, CS:GO id is 730, so I just put 730 in steam_appid.txt.
